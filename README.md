### Hi, I'm Mohammad Saadoon ðŸ‘‹

I am an entrepreneurial spirit Data & AI practitioner who recent graduate from the University of Technology Sydney (UTS), obtaining a Master of Data Science and Innovation (MDSI). Holistic multidisciplinary academic experience in the IT field of Cloud Computing, Augmented Reality, Social network Analysis, Distributed Systems, Big Data, Data Science, Machine Learning and Deep Learning. I also work as Beta Tester for DeepLearning.Ai.

I'm passionate about Deep Learning and Computer Vision, and I feel being a practitioner is not about technology. It's about solving real-world problems and positively impacting society.
