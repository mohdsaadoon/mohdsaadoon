### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Mohammad 

I recently graduated from the University of Technology Sydney (UTS) and obtained a Master of Data Science and Innovation (MDSI). I have developed a multidisciplinary perspective with a holistic academic experience in various IT fields, including Cloud Computing, Augmented Reality, Social Network Analysis, Distributed Systems, Big Data, Data Science, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning. My proficiency lies in Deep Learning frameworks such as TensorFlow, and I have practical experience in building and deploying machine learning models for applications like image classification, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Computer Vision (CV). I possess a strong understanding of Machine Learning concepts, including Neural Networks (NN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Siamese Neural Networks (SNN). I successfully led a Data Science project as part of the UTS Data Science Industry Partnership program. My passion for continuous learning and problem-solving drives me to explore endless possibilities. I am actively seeking job opportunities in Deep Learning, as it offers a pathway to solving real-world problems and positively impacting society.
